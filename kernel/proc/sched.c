/*
 * In this function, you will be modifying the run queue, which can
 * also be modified from an interrupt context. In order for thread
 * contexts and interrupt contexts to play nicely, you need to mask
 * all interrupts before reading or modifying the run queue and
 * re-enable interrupts when you are done. This is analagous to
 * locking a mutex before modifying a data structure shared between
 * threads. Masking interrupts is accomplished by setting the IPL to
 * high.
 *
 * Once you have masked interrupts, you need to remove a thread from
 * the run queue and switch into its context from the currently
 * executing context.
 *
 * If there are no threads on the run queue (assuming you do not have
 * any bugs), then all kernel threads are waiting for an interrupt
 * (for example, when reading from a block device, a kernel thread
 * will wait while the block device seeks). You will need to re-enable
 * interrupts and wait for one to occur in the hopes that a thread
 * gets put on the run queue from the interrupt context.
 *
 * The proper way to do this is with the intr_wait call. See
 * interrupt.h for more details on intr_wait.
 *
 * Note: When waiting for an interrupt, don't forget to modify the
 * IPL. If the IPL of the currently executing thread masks the
 * interrupt you are waiting for, the interrupt will never happen, and
 * your run queue will remain empty. This is very subtle, but
 * _EXTREMELY_ important.
 *
 * Note: Don't forget to set curproc and curthr. When sched_switch
 * returns, a different thread should be executing than the thread
 * which was executing when sched_switch was called.
 *
 * Note: The IPL is process specific.

 * so that no interrupts happen at an inopportune moment.

 * Remember to restore the original IPL before you return from this
 * function. Otherwise, we will not get any interrupts after returning
 * from this function.
 *
 * Using intr_disable/intr_enable would be equally as effective as
 * modifying the IPL in this case. However, in some cases, we may want
 * more fine grained control, making modifying the IPL more
 * suitable. We modify the IPL here for consistency.
