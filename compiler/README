This directory contains the install script which downloads,
configures, compiles, and installs the supported gcc compiler
and binutils for building weenix. Use the --prefix flag to
set the installation prefix. If you are developing on
a network drive you may want to use the --buildir flag to
speed up the installation by compiling gcc in a local directory.
If your machine has multiple cores you can use the -j flag,
it will be passed through to all 'make' instances.
